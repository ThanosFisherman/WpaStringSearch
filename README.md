### Wpa Strings Search ###

A simple, small bash script that helps me search for suspicious strings in order to trace possible WPA key generation algorithms included inside an unpacked router firmware.

### Usage: ###


```
#!shell

chmod +x wpaSearch.sh
chmod +x ansi2html.sh

./wpaSearch.sh bin/ # must be a valid directory to search from
```
